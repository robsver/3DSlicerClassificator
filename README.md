# 3DSlicerClassificator

## Project Description

The classification of third molar extraction is a key factor in oral surgery. Developing a deep learning model to classify the difficulty score of extraction would be useful for surgeons and dentists.
This project aims to create a Slicer module that allows clinicians to obtain an extraction-difficulty grade by providing just the patient CT.
